    "abstract": "This report is the culmination of a year-long study of the users of mySociety websites. The study\nwas conducted by researchers at the University of Manchester as part of an Economic and Social\nResearch Council funded grant project. The main goal of the study was to better understand how\nindividuals use and can benefit from four main mySociety sites in terms of resolving personal,\ncommunity or wider societal issues and problems. A key supporting aim was to develop a\ntransparent and replicable set of tools for measuring the impact of these sites that would help to\ndevelop a â€˜best practiceâ€™ for mySociety and other â€˜e-democracyâ€™ organizations in evaluating their\nsocietal impact. The report provides a summary of the work we undertook, including a\ndescription of its wider social and academic significance and the key findings we produced. It also\npresents detailed description of how we conducted the research and the innovative combination\nof methodologies that were used to answer the central questions posed. ",
